## Problem 1. Very Simple Easy to do Asleep Warmup

Your team has recently learned about the secret ICSSC closet of skeletons and secrets 
hidden deep in the ICS Dungeon! You've decided to break in to steal some of these 
precious secrets for yourself. Before you can start breaking in though, you need 
to do some warm up exercises to practice your coordination.

Write a function `warm_up()` that prints these eight things EXACTLY (by calling `print()` eight times):

- print `hELLO wORLD11` <- basically Hello World!! but with cap lock
- print the text you type to input a laptop computer emoji onto a Discord message
- print the computed result of the smallest of these three values: 420 to the power of 5, 42 to the power of 42, 5 to the power of 420
- print `\n` (not the actual character)
- print `a newline character for real this time`
- print `type the wrods "I\'m looking for Amanda Huginkiss!" then just move on`
- print the answer to this: the number of letters in the word anteater multiplied by the amount of tuition $ you pay towards a gym membership to the ARC every quarter, then add the year UCI was founded, then divide all that by number of operating UCI Shuttle lines <- ask around if you need to find the answer to some of these
- print `last one yay! nvm theres 8 more... jk this is the last one :) oh wait you forgot a quote in the first prompt`
