# Problem 1. Coordination Exercises

Your team has recently learned about the secret ICSSC closet of skeletons and secrets 
hidden deep in the ICS Dungeon! You've decided to break in to steal some of these 
precious secrets for yourself. Before you can start breaking in though, you need 
to do some warm up exercises to practice your coordination.

### The Task

Write a function `warm_up()` that prints these eight things EXACTLY (by calling `print()` eight times):

- print `hELLO wORLD11` <- basically Hello World!! but with cap lock
- print the text you type to input a sunglasses face emoji onto a Discord message
- print the computed result of the smallest of these three values: 420 to the power of 5, 42 to the power of 42, 5 to the power of 420
- print the answer to this calculation: the number of letters in the word "anteater" multiplied by the amount of tuition $ you paid towards a gym membership to the ARC in winter quarter, then add the year UCI was founded, then divide all that by number of operating UCI Shuttle lines <- ask around if you need to find the answer to some of these
- print `type the wrods "I\'m a big kid now!" then move on :)`
